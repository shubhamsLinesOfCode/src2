        From HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to Node.js and the latest frameworks,
        this blog showcases my journey of mastering the art of coding. Here,
        you’ll find insightful blog posts that cover a wide range of topics—from
        web design principles and responsive layouts to complex backend logic
        and database management. Whether I’m sharing personal experiences,
        breaking down coding challenges, or offering tutorials, my goal is to
        inspire and help fellow developers craft their own web projects. This
        blog reflects not just my technical knowledge but also my creative
        process, where coding becomes an art form. Join me as I continually
        learn, build, and share ideas that help shape the future of the web, one
        line of code at a time.

        In terms of organization, I want things to be organized by function, not
        by feature. I want a “components” directory, a “hooks” directory, a
        “helpers” directory, and so on. Sometimes, a complex component will have
        a bunch of associated files. These include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
        "Sub-components", smaller components used exclusively by the main component</li>
        <li>Helper functions</li>
        <li>Custom hooks</li>
        <li>Constants or data shared between the component and its
        associated files</li>
    </ul>

      <p>
        General operations supported by ADTs support the follow operations:
        <ul>
            <li>Traversing, which allows each element in the ADT to be accessed once for processing.</li>
            <li>Searching, which allows the user to look for a specific element in the ADT.</li>
            <li>Inserting, which allows the user to insert an element at a particular index/space in the ADT.</li>
            <li> Deleting, which allows the user to either delete a particular element or delete an element at a particular location.</li>
            <li>Sorting, which allows the elements to be ordered in ascending or descending order, depending on the preference.</li>

        You might have seen the term “ES6” or “JavaScript ES6” and wondered what it actually means. Well wonder no further, because we’re going to dive into what ES6 is and how it relates to JavaScript!
        <br>First, let’s bring in some history. JavaScript was introduced in 1995 by the company Netscape Communications as a scripting language for web designers and programmers to interact with web pages. The next year, Netscape submitted JavaScript to a standards developing organization called Ecma International to create standards for a scripting language (a type of programming language). In 1997, Ecma International released ECMA-262 which sets standards for the first version of a scripting language called ECMAScript, shortened to ES.
        <br>These new ECMAScript standards provided rules for the architecture of JavaScript features. As new programming paradigms emerged and developers sought new features, newer versions of ECMAScript provided a basis for consistency between new and old JavaScript versions.
